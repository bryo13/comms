# comms
Imagine you are in the clandestine service. 

Communication btn your asset and yourself have to be undetactable, so you give him/her a flash drive containing a compiled version of comms.  

The compiled version contains your encrypted IP address and if he/she has the key, communications can be established easily.

Of course no communcation transcripts are stored.
